# 8a: Research Update

This project is due **Thursday March 21**. The goal of this project is to allow you time to delve deeper into a previous project (if you want to), or to explore something entirely new (if you want to). 

Please do one of the following: 

* Revise or improve a previous project, **OR**
* Conduct a preliminary experiment towards a new project. 

Consider the following: 

* If you revise an earlier project, this is a great opportunity to try to make something nice/large/better.
* If you tinker with a preliminary experiment: You have permission to make failed experiments!
* If you're not sure what to do, don't worry, we'll workshop this together in class. 

*Now*, in the Discord channel *#8a-research-update*, document your project/experiment nicely:

* **Include** text which introduces or re-introduces your project — don’t assume that the reader is already familiar with it. 
* **Include** text which discusses your process: how you developed the project, and how you iterated on it. Expect to write 150-200 words, please. 
* **Include** diagrams, sketches, and good photographs of the project at various stages.
