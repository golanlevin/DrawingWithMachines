# 1. Drawing Machine

[**Original assignment here**](https://courses.ideate.cmu.edu/60-428/f2021/index.html%3Fp=41.html). 

Using any materials you wish, create an experimental/DIY/jank drawing machine. Perhaps your machine is an instrument to release the image that is trapped inside some everyday object, or perhaps your machine is a witchcraft you have constructed, and its scribbling is a divination. (For some ideas, see these notes.) Record a brief (10-15 second) video of your machine in action, and take a photograph of the drawing it created. Be sure to have your video and photo ready by the beginning of class on Wednesday, September 1. *Now*,

* Create a blog post on this site.
* Title your blog post, Nickname – Drawing Machine, where “Nickname” is your course nickname.
* Categorize your blog post, *01-DrawingMachine.*
* Upload and embed your video and photograph.
* Write a sentence describing your machine.
