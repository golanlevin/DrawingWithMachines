# 7. Field

[**Original assignment here**](https://courses.ideate.cmu.edu/60-428/f2021/index.html%3Fp=1430.html). 

*Offerings responding to this prompt will be discussed in class on Wednesday, October 13. This set of prompts has two parts:*

* 7.1. Readings on Fields/Distributions
* 7.2. A Field/Distribution Composition (Plotted)

> *Distribution deals with the rhythmic reorganization of pattern structure. It involves movement of unequal elements which are equalized over the surface through the interplay of countermovements between them, rather than by an even repetition of identical design units.*

## 7.1. Readings on Fields/Distributions

Please check out the following three resources:

* **Read** Chapter 2 (“Distribution”, pages 64-71) of *Graphic Games* by Victor Baumgartner. — [PDF](https://github.com/golanlevin/DrawingWithMachines/blob/main/readings/distribution-graphic-games.pdf)
* **Read** “[Flow Fields](https://www.tylerxhobbs.com/words/flow-fields)” by Tyler Hobbs.
* **Skim** this [collection of algorithmic morphogenesis resources](https://github.com/jasonwebb/morphogenesis-resources) by Jason Webb.
* In a blog post, **write** a very brief response to something that you found interesting or helpful from these readings. **Title** your blog post, *Nickname-FieldReading*, and **Categorize** your post, *07-FieldReading*.

## 7.2. A Field/Distribution Composition, Plotted

*The purpose of this prompt is to strengthen your skills in generative form-making with procedures that cover a 2D surface, such as growth algorithms and flow fields. Whereas the Pattern project (#6) invited you to calculate a specific design made from modular units, here, you will likely be indirectly governing a process or simulation that implictly covers the page. You may use any algorithm you wish. The challenge will be making it bend to your will: making it your own.*

**Prompt**: Develop a computationally-generated, machine-plotted artwork that presents a field or distribution across the surface.

To **create** your project:

* **Browse** the materials from [last Wednesday’s lecture](https://courses.ideate.cmu.edu/60-428/f2021/index.html%3Fp=1372.html).
* **Sketch** ideas in your sketchbook. You may use any algorithm you wish, but if you are feeling uncertain or short on time, I encourage you to get started with a Perlin noise flow field.
* **Write** code to generate several compositions. Export SVG files for plotting.
* **Plot** your artwork. You are strongly encouraged to use more than one color in your design. Please do not use standard printer paper.

To **document** your project:

* **Create** a blog post on this website. **Title** your blog post, *Nickname-FieldComposition*, and **Categorize** your blog post, *07-FieldComposition*.
* **Embed** some photographs of your sketches.
* **Embed** some screenshots or SVGs of your generated compositions.
* **Embed** a good-quality photograph of your plotted composition. Consider having a second photograph showing a close detail.
* **Write** a paragraph (of about 100-150 words) describing the logic of your composition, your sources of inspiration, your process, and an evaluation of your results. Be sure to acknowledge any code libraries that you used.
