## Mid-Semester Project

**Revise** one of your previous projects. For example, you might revise your software; you might work to create a high-quality plot; or both.

In a blog post, **document** your project *nicely*. **Include** text which re-introduces your project — don’t assume that the reader is already familiar with it. Also **include** text which discusses your process: how you developed the project, and how you iterated on it. Expect to write 150-200 words, please. **Include** diagrams, sketches, and good photographs of the project at various stages. **Title** your project *Nickname-MidSemester* and **Categorize** it, *08-MidSemester.*
