# 8a: Research Update

This project is due **Thursday March 21**. The goal of this project is to allow you time to delve deeper into a previous project (if you want to), or to explore something entirely new (if you want to). 

Please do one of the following: 

* Revise or improve a previous project, **OR**
* Conduct a preliminary experiment towards a new project. 

Consider the following: 

* If you revise an earlier project, this is a great opportunity to try to make something nice/large/better.
* If you tinker with a preliminary experiment: You have permission to make failed experiments!
* If you're not sure what to do, don't worry, we'll workshop this together in class. 

*Now*, in the Discord channel *#8a-research-update*, document your project/experiment nicely:

* **Include** text which introduces or re-introduces your project — don’t assume that the reader is already familiar with it. 
* **Include** text which discusses your process: how you developed the project, and how you iterated on it. Expect to write 150-200 words, please. 
* **Include** diagrams, sketches, and good photographs of the project at various stages.

# 8b. Self-Directed Project I

* **Casual in-class presentation:** Be prepared to present your current project to peers in small groups on Tuesday 4/9. It's OK if it's a work-in-progress. 
* **Lightweight documentation check-in:** Please upload an image and a couple of sentences to the Discord channel, *#8b-self-directed-I.*

# 8c. Self-Directed Project II

This project can be a continuation of #8b, or a new project altogether — up to you. 

* **For May 1:** Before noon on Wednesday May 1, provide Golan with something to exhibit in the 3rd floor foyer exhibition. This would most likely be a plot or drawing, but potentially it could be a video. Speak with Golan if it's something else. 
* **For May 2:** Participate in the group crit on Thursday, May 2nd, 5:30-8:30pm. You'll be able to hang additional works (e.g. sketches, WIP) in the classroom and/or on rolling pinboards. If you think it would be helpful to explain your project during the crit, you can add non-final documentation to the Discord. Final documentation is due by May 7 (see below).
* **For May 7:** Before noon on May 7, in the Discord channel *#8c-self-directed-II*, document your project/experiment nicely:
  * **Include** text which introduces or re-introduces your project — don’t assume that the reader is already familiar with it. 
  * **Include** text which discusses your process: how you developed the project, and how you iterated on it. Expect to write 150-200 words, please. 
  * **Include** diagrams, sketches, and good photographs of the project at various stages.
