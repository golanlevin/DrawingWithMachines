## 1.3. Shitty Drawing Machine

Using any materials you have at hand, create a shitty drawing machine. Use it to make a shitty drawing. This is a speed project; don't overthink it.

Perhaps your machine is an instrument to release the image that is trapped inside some everyday object. Or perhaps your machine is a witchcraft you have constructed, and its scribbling is graphomancy, a divination. Record a brief video or animated GIF of your system in action, and take a photograph of the drawing it created. A few seconds' duration is probably adequate, but feel free to do what's necessary to explain your project visually (e.g. a time lapse, etc).

Now, your tasks are:
(75 Points) Make a Shitty Drawing Machine:
(40) Create a drawing machine, and use it to make a drawing or two.
(5) Create a post in the #1b-diy-drawing-machine Discord channel.
(5) Name your machine. In your post, tell us your machine's name or title.
(10) Write a couple of sentences about it.
(5) Upload a photograph of your machine.
(5) Upload a photograph of your machine's drawing.
(5) Create and link to a brief video (an "unlisted" video on YouTube is ideal), or upload an animated GIF to Discord. (Note: Discord has an 8MB size limit; consider reducing your GIF's file size with ezgif.com/optimize).
