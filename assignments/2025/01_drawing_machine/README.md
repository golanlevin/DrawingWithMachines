## 1.4. üí©ü§ñüñåÔ∏è Shitty Drawing Machine

![fan drawing machine](img/kanako_ishikawa_drawing_machine.gif)<br />*Kanako Ishikawa used an oscillating fan and a barking puppy toy to create this two-axis [Drawing Machine](https://vimeo.com/305405463), 2018.*

*(75%, due Wednesday 8/27; 4 hours max)*

Using any materials you have at hand, **create** a shitty drawing machine. **Use** it to make a shitty drawing. This is a [speed project](https://fffff.at/speed-project/); don't overthink it.

Perhaps your machine is an instrument to release the drawing that is trapped inside some everyday object. Your project could be a prosthesis or performance partner, whose resulting drawings are duets between human and machine. Or perhaps your machine is a witchcraft, and its scribbling is graphomancy, a divination.

Take some photos of your machine and its drawings, and record a brief video or animated GIF of your system in action. A few seconds' duration (like the GIF above) is probably adequate, but feel free to do what's necessary to explain your project visually (e.g. a time lapse, etc).

*Now*, **provide documentation** of your project through two different channels: 

1. **Present** your documentation in a post in the **Discord channel**, `#1-4-drawing-machine`. The purpose of your Discord post is to make it easy for us to share, browse, and discuss each others' work. (Note: Discord imposes an 8 MB/file limit; for GIFs, consider reducing file size with [ezgif.com/optimize](https://ezgif.com/optimize).)
2. ***Also***, **Submit** your documentation through this [**Google Form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScPxj3o4SNXomiYu4vGqDObooXI_7j4vK2sFzYPpyAIJK6-jQ/viewform?usp=header). The purpose of this form is to ensure that your documentation is collected in a well-organized archive. (Note: This form has a 10 MB/file limit, and requires that you be logged in through CMU.)

In both the Discord post and the Google form: 
 
* **Name** or **title** your machine. 
* **Write** a couple of sentences about your machine.
* Before you upload your images and video to Google drive, **name** your media with *good filenames* ‚Äî like `golan_drawing_machine.jpg`.
* **Upload** a photograph of your drawing machine.
* **Upload** a photograph of your machine's drawing.
* **Create** and **upload** some time-based documentation of your machine in use. This could be an animated GIF or a brief video. (For Discord, link to an "unlisted" video on YouTube).
