## 2.1. Looking Outwards: Tooling

[![Drawingbots.net](../../2024/03_introductory_tooling/img/drawingbots.png)](https://drawingbots.net/resources)

*(20 minutes)* 

The purpose of this exercise is to help introduce you to some of the technical resources and communities for computer controlled pen-plotting machines.

* Spend ten minutes browsing the materials on the [**DrawingBots.net Resources**](https://drawingbots.net/resources) page. This is "the central place on the web to discover the world of drawing robots, get inspiration and talk to other drawing robot enthusiasts." Optionally, check out the affiliated [DrawingBots Discord (invite here)](https://discordapp.com/invite/XHP3dBg). There are lists of recommended pens, various types of SVG generators, many links to code libraries, etc.
* Spend 5-10 minutes browsing the materials at the [**AwesomePlotters Repository**](https://github.com/beardicus/awesome-plotters), "a curated list of code and resources for computer-controlled drawing machines and other visual art robots."
* *Now*, in our Discord channel `#2-1-looking-at-tooling`, **create** a very brief post about a specific technical resource that caught your attention. 
  * **Link** to the resource, 
  * **describe** what it is, and 
  * **write** a sentence about why you found it interesting or potentially useful.

## 2.2. Looking Outwards: Generative Plotter Art

*(30 minutes)* 

The purpose of this prompt is to develop your familiarity with global practices and international communities of people using code to create art with plotters. You can find this work on the following channels, among other places:

* In the book [*Tracing the Line*](https://vetroeditions.com/products/tracing-the-line), in our classroom
* On Twitter/X, using the hashtag [#PlotterTwitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/plottertwitter)
* On Instagram at [#PlotterTwitter](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/plottertwitter/)
* On BlueSky, at [#penplotter](https://bsky.app/hashtag/penplotter) and [#plottertwitter](https://bsky.app/hashtag/plottertwitter)
* In the Feral File exhibition, [*+GRAPH*](https://feralfile.com/explore/exhibitions/graph-8vs)

You can also browse work by some individual contemporary artists who use code and plotters extensively in their practices:

Please spend at least 20 minutes browsing these materials to get a sense of how various people are combining computation and plotter devices. *Now*,

* **Create** a post in the Discord channel, `#2-2-looking-at-art`.
* **Write** a sentence or two reflecting on the work you saw, overall. What was interesting to you? What was disappointing? What opportunities did you see?
* **Identify** a specific artwork you liked, that involved plotters in some way. In your post, **link** to the project's URL, and **embed** an image or screenshot of the project. 
* **Write** another sentence or two, on what you appreciated about this particular project.
