## 2.1. Looking Outwards: Tooling

[![Drawingbots.net](../../2024/03_introductory_tooling/img/drawingbots.png)](https://drawingbots.net/resources)

*(20 minutes)* 

The purpose of this exercise is to help introduce you to some of the technical resources and communities for computer controlled pen-plotting machines.

* Spend ten minutes browsing the materials on the [**DrawingBots.net Resources**](https://drawingbots.net/resources) page. This is "the central place on the web to discover the world of drawing robots, get inspiration and talk to other drawing robot enthusiasts." Optionally, check out the affiliated [DrawingBots Discord (invite here)](https://discordapp.com/invite/XHP3dBg). There are lists of recommended pens, various types of SVG generators, many links to code libraries, etc.
* Spend 5-10 minutes browsing the materials at the [**AwesomePlotters Repository**](https://github.com/beardicus/awesome-plotters), "a curated list of code and resources for computer-controlled drawing machines and other visual art robots."
* *Now*, in our Discord channel `#2-1-looking-at-tooling`, **create** a very brief post about a specific technical resource that caught your attention. 
  * **Link** to the resource, 
  * **describe** what it is, and 
  * **write** a sentence about why you found it interesting or potentially useful.

## 2.2. Looking Outwards: Generative Plotter Art

*(30 minutes)* 

The purpose of this prompt is to develop your familiarity with global practices and international communities of people using code to create art with plotters. You can find this work on the following channels, among other places:

* In the book [*Tracing the Line*](https://vetroeditions.com/products/tracing-the-line), in our classroom
* On Twitter/X, using the hashtag [#PlotterTwitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/plottertwitter)
* On Instagram at [#PlotterTwitter](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/plottertwitter/)
* On BlueSky, at [#penplotter](https://bsky.app/hashtag/penplotter) and [#plottertwitter](https://bsky.app/hashtag/plottertwitter)
* In the Feral File exhibition, [*+GRAPH*](https://feralfile.com/explore/exhibitions/graph-8vs)

You can also browse work by some individual contemporary artists who use code and plotters extensively in their practices:

Please spend about 20 minutes browsing these materials to get a sense of how some artists are combining computation and plotter devices. *Now*,

* **Create** a post in the Discord channel, `#2-2-looking-at-art`.
* **Write** a sentence or two reflecting on the work you saw, overall. What was interesting to you? What was disappointing? What opportunities did you see?
* **Identify** a specific artwork you liked, that involved plotters in some way. In your post, **link** to the project's URL, and **embed** an image or screenshot of the project. 
* **Write** another sentence or two, on what you appreciated about this particular project.

## 2.4. Re-Coding and Plotting Molnár's *Lettres*

![vera_lettres_x2.jpg](img/vera_lettres_x2.jpg)
Two examples of *Lettres de ma Mère* by Vera Molnár, 1988, Spalter Collection.

Vera Molnár began making art with the computer in 1968, ans was among the first dozen or so people to do so. In the mid-1980s, she began a series of plotted works, *Lettres de ma Mère*, which simulated the handwriting of her elderly mother as she became increasingly unwell. In a description of the work, Molnár wrote:

> “My mother had a wonderful hand-writing. There was something gothic in it (it was the style of writing of all well-educated ladies in the Habsburg monarchy in the early XXth century) but also something hysteric. The beginning of every line, on the left side, was always regular, severe, gothic and at the end of each line it became more nervous, restless, almost hysteric. As the years passed, the letters in their totality, became more and more chaotic, the gothic aspect disappeared step by step and only the disorder remained. Every week she wrote me a letter, it was a basic and important event in my visual environment. They were more and more difficult to decipher, but it was so nice to look at them… then, there were no more letters…So I went on to write letters of hers to myself, on the computer of course, simulating the transition between gothic and hysteric.”
