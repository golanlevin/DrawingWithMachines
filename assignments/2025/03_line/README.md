### 3.1.2. Generating Lines of Different Weights


*The purpose of this exercise is to construct a basic drawing primitive from first principles.*

Using your hand, paper, and a single pen with a uniform, fixed-width nib (i.e. non-chiseled and non-squishy, such as a rollerball gel pen), **devise** some methods of constructing lines that appear to have different thicknesses. There’s no single "correct" way to do this; for example, you might:

* Draw a very dense zig-zag
* Draw slightly-offset parallel lines that are closely spaced
* Draw a line very slowly or very quickly, using a pen/paper combo that bleeds ink
* Draw a line which turns out to be, upon closer examination, a decorative border
* Draw a line comprised of a soft cloud of small dots

Be sure to **keep** your hand-made tests. *Now*, using one of your methods,

* **Create** a program that produces "lines" that appear to have different weights. Your program should **generate** SVGs of those lines, such that the lines will appear to have different weights, when plotted using a pen with a uniform nib. *(I say "lines" because in point of fact, each "thick" line may actually be comprised of many constituent sub-lines.)*
	* **Note 1**: For this exercise, you are not permitted to use Z-axis pressure.
	* **Note 2**: The p5.js [`strokeWeight()`](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/strokeWeight/) command will not be helpful.
