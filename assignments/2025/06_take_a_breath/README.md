# 6: Take a Breath

*The main project for this assignment has been merged into Assignment 7.<br />There is no longer a critiquable project due on October 1st. Instead, there are two small exercises:*

* 6.1. Looking Outwards: Something to Import *(due Wednesday 10/1; 15-20 minutes)*
* 6.2. Try an Unfamiliar Machine *(due Wednesday 10/1; 30-120 minutes)*

## 6.1. Looking Outwards: Something to Import

*(Due Wednesday 10/1; 15-20 minutes)*

The purpose of this exercise is to get you thinking — *whether productively or fancifully* — about some concept, material, technique, or other inspiration that you'd like to import into our space. (For the present moment, don't worry too much about the *feasibility* of whether that's possible.) *Now:*

* **Consider** something that you'd like to import into your work in this class. This could be an inspiration like: 
	* a material ("clay", "UV ink", "watercolor", "oil paint sticks"), 
	* a traditional artistic technique ("frottage", "grattage", "intaglio", "piqué"), 
	* a topic or thematic concern ("color", "portraiture", "typography"), 
	* a mode of cultural production ("graffiti", "comics", "infoviz", "zines"),
	* an algorithmic technique ("differential growth", "contour tracing", "CharRNN"),
	* a machine or approach to technology ("laser-cutter", "embroidery", "real-time control"), 
	* an artist whose work you admire
	* something you saw on Instagram
* **Create** a post in the `#61-looking-outwards` Discord channel.
* **Write** a few sentences describing the thing, why you find it interesting, and what sorts of possibilities you can imagine by combining it with approaches from this course.
* **Include** a URL link to more information about the thing. 
* **Embed** an image of the thing. 

*We will share these with each other in small round-table discussions. This exercise will be checked but ungraded.*

## 6.2. Try an Unfamiliar Machine 

*(Due Wednesday 10/1; 30-120 minutes)*

You are asked to make a "hello world" plot on a machine you have not used previously. You are welcome to develop a creative project if you wish, but it will be sufficient to plot a test-grid or our [default Lissajous figure](lissajous.svg). The results of this exercise will be shared and/or celebrated, but not critiqued. Some possible devices you could try include: 

* [HP7475A plotter](https://github.com/golanlevin/DrawingWithMachines/blob/main/machines/hp7475a/hp7475a-one-sheet/hp7475a-one-sheet.md)
* [HP DraftMaster II](https://github.com/golanlevin/DrawingWithMachines/tree/main/machines/hp_draftmaster)
* [Line-Us Plotter](https://github.com/golanlevin/DrawingWithMachines/blob/main/machines/line-us/README.md)
* [USCutter MH871-MK2](https://github.com/golanlevin/DrawingWithMachines/blob/main/machines/uscutter-mh871-mk2/README.md)
* [Bantam ArtFrame 1824](https://github.com/golanlevin/DrawingWithMachines/blob/main/machines/bantam_artframe_1824/README.md)
* [Silhouette Portrait 4 vinyl cutter](https://github.com/fablabnbg/inkscape-silhouette)
* [Rotrics DexArm robot arm](https://github.com/CreativeInquiry/Rotrics_control)
* [Viking CNC embroidery machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDE2Tx6HHLc) (Art; IDeATe; STUDIO)
* [CNC Quilting machine](https://textiles-lab.github.io/) (SCS Textiles Lab)
* School of Art CNC router
* 1W laser projector

*Now:*

* **Employ** an unfamiliar machine to plot a test-pattern or basic design.
* **Create** a post in the `#62-new-machine` Discord channel.
* **Write** a couple reflective sentences about your process.
* **Embed** a photograph of your plot. 

*Note: getting some devices to work may require a greater investment of time than others. This exercise will be checked but ungraded.*
