## 8.2. Experiment Presentation

For Wednesday, November 5: 

* **Create** a post in the Discord channel, `#8-experiment`. 
* In the post, please **write** a few sentences about your experiment. What were you curious about and why? What new things did you try? What did you learn from your experiments?
* In your post, **include** several images of your experiment — if possible, include images of both the process and the product. 
* On Wednesday 11/5: work that can be pinned up should be pinned up, but you will also be asked to **share a brief presentation** about your experiment at the projector/podium. Most likely, you will present from your Discord post.
