It's day 2 of our "Drawing with Machines" plotter workshop at Anderson Ranch near Aspen, and there's already lovely generative artworks in progress by Chris Coleman, Caleb Ogg, Harley Turan, and many others.

On Day 3 of our "Drawing with Machines" workshop at Anderson Ranch, Elliott Spelman generated novel faces with Quick!Draw data — and then made a real-time portrait machine using ZKM Karlsruhe's ofxTensorFlow2, Nick Hardeman's ofxHPGL, and a vintage HP7475A pen plotter.

More of today's experiments from our #generativeArt workshop at Anderson Ranch: hand-colored spring by Lea Eaton; differential growth cyanotype by Harley Turan; multicolor plot by Caleb Ogg; plot-in-progress of a vectorized physarum simulation by Moishe Lettvin:

The seven AxiDraws in our workshop sound like a roomful of chirping crickets. Kudos to EMSL for an amazing line of artist tools, and their incredibly responsive customer service when we had a (rare) issue.

Plein-air drawing, but by whom? In our generative plotter art workshop at Anderson Ranch today, Deanna Gelosi — Tinkering Studio alum, CUAtlas PhD student, and AxiDraw cyborg — expressed a posthuman squiggle through her computer-controlled finger-painting apparatus.

More images of Deanna Gelosi's plein-air mechatronic fingerpainting studies from our "Drawing with Machines" workshop at Anderson Ranch — including 4-up paintings exploring the nuances of automation and repetition.

Some projects from Day 4 of our "Drawing with Machines" plotter workshop at Anderson Ranch: vectorized physarum simulation by Moishe Lettvin; 3D-to-2D projection study by Satre Stuelke; Multilayer interpolations by Lea Eaton; moiré discs by Caleb Ogg.

The final day of the workshop at lovely Anderson Ranch was a whirlwind. Here are some more highlights. (Stylized photogrammetry landscape by Chris Coleman; skeletonized reaction-diffusion and differential growth T-shirt design by Harley Turan):

Elliott Spelman completed his impromptu contour-capture kiosk. Every 20 seconds, the system extracted and plotted the outline of whomever was gawking at it.

At our plein-air AxiDraw station, Deanna Gelosi and her partner Travis Uhrig continued their cyborg finger-painting experiments. Here, Deanna is obligingly helping the machine execute a generative squiggle; it dips her finger in paint to reload between strokes. ([Here](img/travis_uhrig_plotterfinger.mp4) is a related video.)

On the final day, all of the participants in our plotter workshop made generative cards for a print exchange. (Some cards were individually personalized by/for the recipients, such as Elliott Spelman's body contours and Harley Turan's overplotted photos.)

More generative art cards from the print exchange of our plotter workshop at Anderson Ranch: curlicues by Chris Coleman; arc play by Caleb Ogg; interpolated profiles by Golan Levin; vectorized Physarum simulations by Moishe Lettvin...


...and both positive and negative (resist) generative plotter-fingerpaintings by Deanna Gelosi + Travis Uhrig!

For me, the highlight of our workshop at Anderson Ranch was an unplanned colab: student Lea Eaton, and ceramics student Joey Glickman, joined forces to create a set of sgraffito Truchet/Wang tiles (generated with differential growth & hobby curves)!

Bonus pic: Lea & Joey generously shared their developing understanding of CNC sgraffito techniques with other students in our plotter workshop at Anderson Ranch. Here, Lea uses the AxiDraw to execute a generative curlicue design, by Chris Coleman, into a clay slab.
