### Exercise: Instructional Drawing in Reverse

*Exercise courtesy of Paolo Pedercini.*

Below are some screenshots of a well-known generative artwork from 2003. Analyze it and try to “reverse engineer” the algorithm that produces similar images (only the lines; colors are not important for this exercise). In your sketchbook or on your computer, describe the process using the minimum amount of clear, non ambiguous instructions. Discuss.

The work is [*Substrate*](http://www.complexification.net/gallery/machines/substrate/) by Jared Tarbell (2003). A working re-implementation by Tom White is [here](https://dribnet.github.io/substrate/).
