## Welcome

### Studio Knowledge, Machine Literacy, and Peer Support



* **If you are a returning student:** *thank you* for being here again. Youâ€™re part of what makes this studio robust, responsive, and delightful. Your expertise helps lift everyone up.



### Overview of Digital Resources & Workflows


* This semester, my primary vehicle for delivering information **to you** will be this [**Drawing with Machines GitHub**](https://github.com/golanlevin/DrawingWithMachines/tree/main). Here you will be able to find my [Lectures](../), [Assignments](../../../assignments/2025/README.md), [Machinery Instructions](../../../machines/README.md), and much more.
* This semester, you will have three main channels for **sharing and documenting** your work: 
  * Our private **Discord** server, where you will post writeups about your work. You can also use this Discord to ask for help, coordinate with each other, and offer comments, encouragement, and feedback to your peers. *Check your email for the invite link*. 
  * My own **Google Forms**, such as [this one](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScPxj3o4SNXomiYu4vGqDObooXI_7j4vK2sFzYPpyAIJK6-jQ/viewform?usp=header), which I will use to collect, organize, and archive high-quality documentation of your work.
  * Our public-facing [**course Instagram**](https://www.instagram.com/drawingwithmachines/), a collectively-managed space for our class to document and share our work, process, and experiments. In order for us to share this account, I have developed some [**Policies**](https://github.com/golanlevin/DrawingWithMachines/blob/main/syllabus/instagram_policies.md). Your participation in this Instagram is encouraged but optional.

## Unit 1: Loosening Up with DIY Drawing Machines

*In which we allow ourselves to make shitty machines and even shittier drawings.* 

### A Discussion about Machines and Drawings

**Show**: Ruler, stencil, spirograph, pantograph, doodletop...

What is a *drawing*? List your assumptions.

* A drawing is made by one person.
* A drawing is made on paper...

What is a *machine*? List your assumptions.

* A machine is electric.
* A machine is not a living thing...

What is a *drawing tool*? List your assumptions. 

* A drawing tool is held in one's hand.
* A drawing tool only makes contact with the paper at one point...
* How much difference does it make if we say drawing *tool*, *toy*, *machine*, *apparatus*...?
