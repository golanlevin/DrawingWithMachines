# September 1: Labor Day

## âž› Optional Work Session

Today is [Labor Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Day), a federal holiday which honors and recognizes the American labor movement. **You are not required to come to class.** 

However, if you do happen to come to our space, I will be holding informal office hours and an optional workday in the classroom. I will be available to answer questions, provide informal instruction and advising, or simply shoot the breeze.
