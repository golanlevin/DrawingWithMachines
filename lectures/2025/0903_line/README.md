> *“A line is a miracle that you draw when you throw it.”* — Masahiko Sato

"A trailblazer in Japan’s media landscape since the 1990s, Sato Masahiko has created innovative yet approachable content across a wide range of platforms―including TV commercials, educational programs, books, and games. The breadth and diversity of his work is remarkable, especially considering it was created by a single individual."
 
Here is the short documentary [*CURVES*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Be3R5YEKFN0&t=20s) (2008) by [Masahiko Sato](https://yokohama.art.museum/eng/exhibition/202506_satomasahiko/). We will watch 0:20–6:45 and 13:20–19:20.

American choreographer William Forsythe served as artistic director of the Frankfurt Ballet from 1984 until 2004, and was known for the integration of ballet and visual arts, In 1999, he released “Improvisation Technologies“, a CD-ROM that detailed his understanding of fundamental primitives of human movement and the language of dance. These are illustrated through 2D white lines that have been hand-rotoscoped onto the video. Despite their formal and technical simplicity, the results are extremely compelling.
