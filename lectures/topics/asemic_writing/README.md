# Asemic Writing

![pink-alien.gif](img/pink-alien.gif)

[Asemic writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asemic_writing) is a wordless open semantic form of writing. The word asemic means “having no specific semantic content,” or “without the smallest unit of meaning.” With the non-specificity of asemic writing there comes a vacuum of meaning, which is left for the reader to fill in and interpret. Asemic writing explores the liminal territories between familiarity and chaos, language and gesture.

Work by Mirtha Dermisache (1970s). Dermisache composed books, letters, and newspapers with entirely unreadable script. She shows how page layout, paragraph blocks, and line cadence alone can trigger the *experience* of reading:

This is research by S.E. Petersen (1995), showing activation of the cortex by “word-like stimuli” including what she called “false fonts”, or letters from an imaginary alphabet. Neuroscience finds that letter-like shapes can activate reading areas even when they’re not real letters. For us, this suggests a design space of “glyph statistics” (junctions, curvature, spacing) that evoke literacy without language:

Two engineered scripts: one rationalizing letters by mouth shapes, the other a community-building phonetic system. Writing systems are designed artifacts with social, cognitive, and aesthetic goals.

The *Alphabet Organique* (France, 1780s) was an attempt to redesign the alphabet (coincident with the creation of the metric system) based on the configurations of the mouth. Meanwhile, the *Deseret Alphabet* (1847-1854) was "revealed by God" to the founder/prophet of the Mormon religion, as a way of keeping out unwanted influences, and unifying a worldwide congregation:

[Hélène Smith](http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/1/i_martian.php)’s “Martian”. Spiritualist automatic writing presented as an extraterrestrial language. A case study in how conviction, repetition, and script-like structure can create the feeling of language — a fluent, internally consistent pseudo-script.

Paul Klee, *Frontière* (1938). Klee treats line as a thinking tool between drawing and writing. His marks behave like signs that almost cohere into an alphabet—useful inspiration for evolving a minimal mark vocabulary in code.

Miró’s pseudo-calligraphy turns paint into script-like signals; Munari invents “illegible writings” with internal rules. Together they model a path: define constraints first, then let gesture and variation play inside them.

Joan Miro: *surreal writing* (1940s);
Bruno Munari, *Scritture Illegibili di popoli Sconosciuti* (1940s):

![alpha_miro_munari](img/alpha_miro_munari.jpg)

Munari: 

> “Every people has its own writing, that of the Arabs and different from that of the Chinese, which is different from that of Sri Lanka and so on. However, each of these scriptures has a precise graphic rule for reading to be facilitated. These writings (for us illegible) are legible for the respected peoples. Why not try to construct other systems with other specially designed rules? What do you read? I do not know. These scriptures are also as beautiful as a drawing.”

Munari argues that legibility is culturally constructed and rule-bound. The invitation is clear: invent new rule sets—directionality, stroke order, grouping—and see what “legible” means to a new audience.

Max Ernst, “[Maximiliana ou L’Exercise illégal de l’Astronomie](https://www.google.com/search?q=Max+Ernst,+Maximiliana+ou+L%27Exercice+ill%C3%A9gal+de+l%27Astronomie&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjQpfeRsJnZAhXyx1kKHWyZD3oQ_AUICygC&biw=1272&bih=831)” (1964).

A universe of invented signs wrapped in the authority of prints and plates. Max Ernst exploits the aesthetics of cataloging and astronomy to make nonsense feel documentarian.

Luigi Seraphini, *Codex Seraphinianus* (1981). An encyclopedic world with a script that looks systematized but defies decoding. Page design, diagrams, and consistent glyph morphologies create plausibility.

Alexander Calder, *Balloons* (1973)

Xu Bing, *A Book from the Sky* (1987-1991). Thousands of plausible but unreadable “characters,” carved and printed like classical texts. Authority of material and layout makes viewers work to read—an archetype for generative fake-scripts and page systems.

Manfred Mohr, another early computer artist. Early algorithmic drawing where rule-driven marks form an abstract “script.”

Roman Verostko, an early algorithmic artist, active in computer art since the early 1970s. Code-based procedures drive pen and brush to produce calligraphic swarms. Verostko bridges algorithm and gesture.

A neural net trained on kanji generates novel, kanji-like glyphs. It’s a machine hallucination of writing statistics—great for thinking about data, priors, and how far plausibility can go without meaning.

### Throughline

Asemic writing operates in the pre-semantic layer of writing: the cues that tell our eyes “this is text” before any decoding—stroke order, baseline, x-height, ligatures, line justification, paragraphing, repetition, and material authority (ink, paper, typesetting). Artists and systems designers exploit those cues to evoke reading without language. For computational practice, the key is to define a rule system (gesture grammar, page grammar, stroke physics) and then let controlled variation generate an evolving “script.”

## A Possible Assignment

Write a computer program that generates forms that resemble writing.

Think carefully about what constitutes writing. From Wikipedia:

> Writing is a medium of human communication that represents language and emotion with signs and symbols. In most languages, writing is a complement to speech or spoken language. Writing is not a language, but a tool used to make languages readable. Within a language system, writing relies on many of the same structures as speech, such as vocabulary, grammar, and semantics, with the added dependency of a system of signs or symbols. The result of writing is called text, and the recipient of text is called a reader. Motivations for writing include publication, storytelling, correspondence, record keeping and diary. Writing has been instrumental in keeping history, maintaining culture, dissemination of knowledge through the media and the formation of legal systems.

Please read the Wikipedia article on Writing Systems, which I quote here:

> The general attributes of writing systems can be placed into broad categories such as alphabets, syllabaries, or logographies. Any particular system can have attributes of more than one category. In the alphabetic category, there is a standard set of letters (basic written symbols or graphemes) of consonants and vowels that encode based on the general principle that the letters (or letter pair/groups) represent speech sounds. In a syllabary, each symbol correlates to a syllable or mora. In a logography, each character represents a word, morpheme, or other semantic units. Other categories include abjads, which differ from alphabets in that vowels are not indicated, and abugidas or alphasyllabaries, with each character representing a consonant–vowel pairing. Alphabets typically use a set of 20-to-35 symbols to fully express a language, whereas syllabaries can have 80-to-100, and logographies may have several hundreds of symbols. Most systems will typically have an ordering of its symbol elements so that groups of them can be coded into larger clusters like words or acronyms (generally lexemes), giving rise to many more possibilities (permutations) in meanings than the symbols can convey by themselves. Systems will also enable the stringing together of these smaller groupings (sometimes referred to by the generic term ‘character strings’) in order to enable a full expression of the language.

Give thought to your symbols: how they are (individually) composed, and how they are visually sequenced into higher-level ordered structures.
