# Material Conditions

* The **order** of strokes matters. 
* The **direction** of strokes matters.
* The **speed** of strokes matters.
* The **pressure** of strokes matters.
* The **substrate** matters.
* The **stylus** matters.
* The **ink** matters.

The **order** of strokes matters:

The **direction** of strokes matters.

The **speed** of strokes matters. Consider the precise control of a physical process. Move slowly or hold the pen in one spot, the ink spreads: a function of medium, substrate, and time.

Drawing is done on a **substrate** — usually paper. Paper can be varied creatively. 

[Daniela Krohnert](https://penplotterartwork.com/blog/2021/10/27/weather-as-art-inspiring-pen-plot-art/) left out a sheet of paper for a few minutes during a Viennese summer rainstorm. The paper dried curled, and created an uneven texture when plotting 42 straight lines.<br />![daniela_krohnert_weathered_paper.jpg](img/daniela_krohnert_weathered_paper.jpg)

Drawing can be done through **incision** and **etching**. 

The whiskers in this drawing are *incised*.<br />![incised-marks.jpg](img/incised-marks.jpg)

Patricio Gonzalez-Vivo [has been using AxiDraw for circuit board etching experiments.](https://www.evilmadscientist.com/2018/pcb-etching-with-axidraw/) He draws on copper clad boards with a Sharpie marker with the AxiDraw. Drawing is followed by a chemical bath, which etches away the non-drawn area. The marker is cleaned off of the remaining copper to reveal the design.<br />![gonzalez-vivo-circuit-etching.jpg](img/gonzalez-vivo-circuit-etching.jpg)

Drawing is a **physical process**. You can interpose appurtenances to meddle with these physics.

[Mike Jacobs added a pantograph to his AxiDraw to multiply its size range](https://www.evilmadscientist.com/2018/axidraw-pantograph/), increasing the range from 9×12” to 45×58”.<br />![jacobs_pantograph2.jpg](img/jacobs_pantograph2.jpg)

Here's a [thread by Daniel Feles involving interposed physics](https://twitter.com/dfeles/status/1223962631012339712).<br />![physics-and-plotters.gif](img/physics-and-plotters.gif)

The **ink** (marking medium) matters.

Marcel Schwittlick has [explored dying pens](https://schwittlick.net/composition52/).<br />![c52_dying_rotring_web03.jpg](img/c52_dying_rotring_web03.jpg)

Tobias Grothman used invisible ink, which reveals the solution to a maze under UV light.<br />![tobias_grothman_maze_postcard_uv.jpg](img/tobias_grothman_maze_postcard_uv.jpg)

There are some really [wild inks out there](https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/129i2e9/what_are_the_most_unique_inks_youve_tried/). This is "Wearingeul Taxidermied Genius", a magenta ink with a metallic green sheen.<br />![wearingeul-ink.jpg](img/wearingeul-ink.jpg)
