# Plotting with the Line-Us

"Line-us is an internet connected robot drawing arm. It's small, portable and draws with a nice wobbly line using a real pen on paper."

* [**Getting Started with Line-us Programming**](https://github.com/Line-us/Line-us-Programming): The central source for programming Line-Us.

#### Line-Us with Python

* [The Official Line-us Python Module](https://github.com/Line-us/Line-us-Programming#official-python-module-for-line-us). It includes machine discovery via DNS-sd and access to all of the Line-us GCodes. There is a [quickstart guide](https://lineuspythonmodule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#quickstart), full [documentation](https://lineuspythonmodule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#module-lineus), and its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Line-us/LineUsPythonModule).

* [WebSockets Python example](https://github.com/Line-us/Line-us-Programming/blob/master/Python/HelloWorldWebsockets.py)

#### Line-Us with JavaScript

* [@beardicus/line-us](https://github.com/beardicus/line-us): A JavaScript library for controlling the Line-us drawing robot via its websocket interface. Works in both Node.js and the browser.
* [basic example using node/js](https://github.com/pandrr/line-us): sends an array of commands to the line-us drawing machine via a net.Socket connection; a port of the HelloWorld.py example.

#### Line-Us with Processing

* [Processing code for a very simple example](https://github.com/Line-us/Line-us-Programming/blob/master/Processing/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.pde)

#### Other Line-Us Software

* This is a [readymade SVG plotter for Line-Us](https://github.com/tbertz/LineUs_SVG/tree/release/v0.2), updated for Processing v.3.

## Line-Us Setup

![Line-Us on its plate](images/calibration3.jpg)

* **Download** and install the Line-Us app for your operating system from [line-us.com/software.html](https://www.line-us.com/software.html). (I've stashed a backup of the MacOS v3.0.0.33 app [here](tools/line-us-3.0.0build33.dmg), current as of 6/2001.) Don't launch the app yet. 
* **Arrange** Line-Us on its magnetic plate as shown above. When the pen is in its 'neutral' (home) position, it should be over the small hole.
* **Connect** Line-Us into a USB power supply or USB port, and wait for its light to flash blue.
* Hold its button down for 2 seconds until the light flashes red (putting the robot in "setup mode"). 
* **Connect** your computer to the new "Line-us-Setup" WiFi network. (Line-Us is now broadcasting a new temporary WiFi network called "Line-us-Setup" and is waiting for your computer to join this network. If necessary, you can also use this network when there is no local WiFi.)
* **Launch** the Line-Us app, and **instruct** Line-us how to join your local WiFi. You can now reconnect your computer to the local WiFi, too. See [here](https://www.line-us.com/help.html) for more detailed instructions on connecting to the WiFi. (The next time you turn Line-Us on it will automatically connect to the last WiFi it was on.) The light on Line-Us should be solid blue. 
* **Verify** that Line-Us is able to communicate and draw by making a scribble in the app (with the "Draw"/pencil mode), and then execute the drawing with the "Play" button in the upper right. 
* You can access more settings by horizontally dragging/sliding the buttons at the top of the Line-Us app. There you can access controls for **setting the pen height**. More information on setting the pen height is [here](https://www.line-us.com/help.html#3).
* You can also check to see if Line-Us is connectable on your local network, by typing its name correctly in the address bar of your browser. For example, one of our robots is named *sfci-lineus-1*, and you can see its vital information at: [http://sfci-lineus-1.local/](http://sfci-lineus-1.local/), which should look something like the following:

## Line-Us + p5.js

This section describes workflows for controlling Line-Us from p5.js. These workflows all use the JavaScript [Line-Us library by @beardicus](https://github.com/beardicus/line-us), which establishes a work area of 1125 (w) x 2000 (h) units, with approximately 20 units per millimeter. 

*Note: p5.js cannot run Line-Us from sketches served online at https://editor.p5js.org, because Line-Us does not support secure web sockets, and browsers require secure websocket connections for https: sites like the p5 Editor. This issue is discussed [here](https://forum.line-us.com/t/https-secure-websockets-only/586).*

#### Example projects 

* [lineus_p5js_calibration](p5js/lineus_p5js_calibration): a calibration grid (see image below). *Expect some nonlinearities*. * [lineus_p5js_lissajous](p5js/lineus_p5js_lissajous): a simple Lissajous figure.* [lineus_p5js_mouserecording](p5js/lineus_p5js_mouserecording): a mouse gesture is recorded into an array of points, and then rendered by the robot when the user presses a key.
* [lineus_p5js_realtime](p5js/lineus_p5js_realtime): control Line-Us in real-time with the cursor.

#### Instructions with a local server

1. Download the complete directories for the examples you want to run (for example, in [this .zip](https://github.com/golanlevin/DrawingWithMachines/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)). 
2. In MacOS Terminal, ```cd lineus_p5js_lissajous``` (or whichever directory your sketch is in).
3. In Terminal, launch a local server, as described [here](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server): ```python -m http.server```
4. In your browser, visit ```http://localhost:8000```. The sketch should run, and the Line-Us robot should be controlled by the sketch. 

#### Instructions using p5.js Mode in the Processing IDE

*This workflow has been tested with Processing IDE versions 3.5.4 and 4.0a4 in MacOS 10.15.7.*

1. If you have not already done so, download and install the Processing IDE from [here](https://processing.org/download/). Launch the Processing IDE.
2. If you have not already done so, install the "p5.js Mode" for the Processing IDE. To do this, look for the *modes* menu on the top right corner of the IDE and select *Add mode…*. Select the p5.js Mode from the list and click *Install* to get it. Make sure it is the current mode. 
3. Download the complete directories for the examples you want to run (for example, in [this .zip](https://github.com/golanlevin/DrawingWithMachines/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)).
4. In the Processing IDE, File->Open the sketch you want to run. Navigate to its directory and open (for example) the file ```lineus_p5js_lissajous.js```.
5. Click the Run button in the upper left of the IDE. Your preferred browser should open up the sketch, hosted in a local server. The Line-Us robot should be controlled by the sketch.
