The Rotring NC-Scriber CS-100 is a standalone electronic lettering machine developed in the 1980s for technical drafting applications. It combines a membrane keyboard with a precision plotting arm that moves a pen to draw typed text onto paper, creating consistent, mechanically-rendered lettering.

To operate it, place a sheet of paper under the plotting head, select a lettering size, and type on the built-in keyboard. The CS-100 draws each character in sequence using vector strokes, and includes controls for spacing and centering. There is no external communications port; the device is used manually.
