## TL,DR:

Your grade will be based on your professionalism in (**1**) completing work, and in (**2**) communicating responsibly about your attendance, as follows:

1. **Do The Assignment Checklists.** There is zero mystery how your work will be graded in this course. Every assignment has a clearly defined list of very simple tasks. Do all the tasks and you will receive full credit on the assignment. Your semester grade will be based on completing a certain number of assignments, according to a [Labor-Based Grading Contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_grading).
2. **No Ghosting.** If you need to miss class, inform the professor at the earliest possible opportunity. You are welcome to communicate by email, Discord, Twitter, or text message. Your first "*[no call, no-show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_call,_no_show)*" event will reduce your semester grade by one letter (A→B). **Your second "*no-call, no-show*" event will cause you to fail the class.**

*Full details about these requirements are below.*

# OVERVIEW

### Course Description

This is an intermediate/advanced studio course in experimental drawing, generative art, computational design, and mechatronic mishegoss. Working at the boundaries of creative code, automation, physical materials, and gestural mark-making, we will explore personal and peculiar new approaches to digital imaging; the development of ultra-niche workflows as a mode of creative practice; and the use of algorithms and machine collaborators as nontraditional intermediaries between mind, hand, and paper. Drawings will be created using AxiDraw plotters and a variety of other specialized machinery. Interested students should have JavaScript and/or Python programming experience equivalent to an introductory course such as 15-104, 15-110 or 15-112.

Units in this course include: rule-based art and conditional design; computational and generative form; synthetic automatism, chance and stochastic composition; and real-time interaction and contingency. Through rigorous exercises in freestyle computing, participants will develop skills in the control of machines such as (e.g.) AxiDraw, Line-Us, Scribit, Rotrics, and Universal Robots to govern line, texture, tone, shape and mass in a variety of wet and dry drawing media. Interested students should have a portfolio of creative visual work, and programming experience equivalent to an introductory course such as 15-104, 110 or 112. Enrollment by permission of instructor.

### Learning Objectives
At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to:

* Be proficient in creating computer programs to execute drawings with machines, using a variety of different programming toolkits.
* Gain familiarity with the repertoire of artists, designers, works and activities around algorithmic art with robots and mechatronic plotters.
* Understand the role of computation in making drawings that explore concepts of procedurality and generativity.
* Understand how to document and present creative work online and in person.

### Unit Topics

1. Rule-Based Art
2. Introductory Tooling
3. Exercises with Lines 
4. Hatching and Fills
5. Shapes and Clipping
6. Texture (Flows and Feedback)
7. Personal Project (Material Conditions, Animation, Color, Type, Data, Real-Time Control)
8. Card Exchange

### Prerequisite Knowledge
*What prior knowledge must students have in order to be successful in this course?*

* This is an intermediate/advanced studio course, intended for students who have already had at least one semester of elementary programming (in any language). Students must be familiar and comfortable with computer programming fundamentals, such as iteration, conditional testing, functional abstraction, static and dynamic memory structures, and object-oriented programming, as taught in a course like 15-104, 15-110, or 15-112.
* Students are expected to have had some prior experience with a creative coding toolkit for the arts, such as p5.js or Processing. 
* This is a *polyglot* course, taught using a combination of JavaScript, Java, and Python. Students fluent in only one language may need to do some additional preparation.
* A strong foundation in mathematics, especially including geometry, algebra, and trigonometry, will be very helpful.


### Extra Time Commitments

* There are no *specific* extra time committments outside of regularly posted meeting times. However, students will need to use plotting equipment outside of class time.

# ADMINISTRATA

### Communication Tools
This course uses the following software tools to share information:

* **A Discord Server**, for posting your work, as well as for course announcements, and informal communication. 
* **Email**. Important announcements may appear by both Discord and email. Ignore emails at your peril. 
* **A Google Calendar**, [http://bit.ly/golancoursecalendar](http://bit.ly/golancoursecalendar), with key dates.
* **Zoom**. Although this course is expected to be IPO (In-Person Only), it is possible that some sessions may be conducted remotely, as necessary or appropriate. 

### Access to Plotting Equipment
You will likely execute your assignments using the plotter equipment at in CFA-303. However: 

* If you happen to possess your own plotter equipent, you are welcome/encouraged to use it.
* If you happen to have access to hardware elsewhere on campus which can be used for mark-making (such as the robot arms in the School of Architecture dFab, or the School of Art CNC router), you are welcome/encouraged to do so, but you're on your own to seek assistance with that equipment if you need it.
* We have several tiny [Line-Us](https://www.line-us.com/) plotters which may be signed out with the professor's permission. If you are traveling or quarantined, you may request to borrow one.

During spring 2024, CFA-303 is available for plotting during the following times: 

* Tuesday/Thursdays, after 5pm (i.e. during class)
* All day Fridays (the professor and/or TA may be present)
* All day Saturdays and Sundays (if you have a room key)
* Monday/Wednesdays, 11am-7pm 
* Tuesday/Thursdays, 8am-Noon

The room is busy MW 8-11am; MW 7-10pm; TR 12:30-5.

### Required Tools

* **Personal Sketchbook**. It is extremely wise to plan your projects on paper before writing any code. In support of this, you are required to maintain a personal sketchbook for this course.
* **Laptop**. Students should have access to a personal laptop. 
* **Software**. Recent, well-updated installations of Mac OSX, Windows or Linux are all acceptable operating systems. However, although all of the programming toolkits with which we work are free and cross-platform, it is possible that example projects may only be provided for Mac OSX. This is a polyglot course; the programming environments used for example projects and sample code will be a mixture of p5.js (JavaScript), Processing (Java), and Python.
* **Camera**. Students should have access to some sort of camera to document their work. A smartphone with a camera is acceptable.

### Art Supplies to Purchase

Although some limited supplies exist in our classroom, you will be expected to obtain your own art supplies, such as pens, pencils, markers, and paper, according to your individual interests. The following list of supplies is a *minimum baseline* of a few common supplies you should expect to need. 

* Strathmore 300 Series Bristol pad (270 g/m), 9"W x 12"H, smooth surface (*not vellum*), 20 sheets (Product #342-9): [$9.86 at Artist & Craftsman PGH](https://artistcraftsman.com/strathmore-300-series-bristol-pads/); [$8.49 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Strathmore-Bristol-Smooth-Bound-Sheets/dp/B00254AU8Q/); [$8.39 at Dick Blick](https://www.dickblick.com/items/strathmore-300-series-bristol-pad-9-x-12-smooth-20-sheets/)
* Itoya Original Art Profolio - 9"W x 12"H, Black, Portrait, 24 Pages portfolio book: [$16.74 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Itoya-Profolio-Original-Presentation-Inches/dp/B0000AE68P/?th=1), [$13.89 at Dick Blick](https://www.dickblick.com/items/itoya-original-art-profolio-12-x-9-black-portrait-24-pages/)
* PILOT G2 Rolling Ball Gel Pens, Fine Point (0.7mm), Black: [$5.77 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Pilot-Retractable-Premium-Roller-31078/dp/B0058NN4C0/), [$6.79 at Target](https://www.target.com/p/pilot-5ct-g2-gel-pens-fine-point-0-7mm-black-ink/-/A-16722573) **OR** PILOT Precise V7 Premium Rolling Ball pens, 0.7mm, Black: [$5.77 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WMDNI02/)
* A pencil-case.

The total cost of these supplies is around $30-40, but you will likely want to experiment with other media. If you are looking for other recommended supplies for pen-plotting, please see [the list at Drawingbots.net](https://drawingbots.net/knowledge/supplies). Please be sure to put your name on your belongings. 

Obtaining art supplies that are required for a course should not present a financial hardship. Last year, the CMU Student Senate, led by undergraduates from the School of Art, made it possible for 
students to get funds for art supplies using the [*Special Circumstance Request Form*](https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/special-circumstance-request/index.html).


### Our Studio Space 

* Please clean up after yourself. 
* If you don't feel well, please stay home.
* **No food or drink**. This is both a drawing course and a creative coding course. Greasy food and spilled liquids are incompatible with fancy paper and laptops.

# ATTENDANCE

### Excused Absences

Your presence, collegial conduct, civic participation, and responsible communication are of paramount importance. That said, I also recognize that students may occasionally need to miss class for a variety of reasons (e.g. illness, religious observance, job interview, family emergency, etc.). The attendance policy for this course is simple: 

**If you are unable to attend a class session, send a message prior to Roll Call.** You may message me by email, Discord, Twitter, or text message. Informing me of your absence can help me help you; for example, I may be able to record or stream a presentation.

I can be extremely understanding and accommodating about planned and necessary absences, family circumstances, and/or medical issues when you inform me in a timely and professional manner. Such absences will have no impact on your final grade. If you must miss a significant number of sessions, please come and discuss the issue with me; I would like to find a way to support you.

When you send me a message informing me of an upcoming absence, I don't need to know the detailed reason. It's sufficient and courteous to offer a general category, such as "I'm not feeling well". (Please do not tell me "I need to do homework for another course"; this insult will not affect your grade, but it will anger and disappoint me.)

You are responsible for what happens in class whether you’re here or not. Organize with your classmates to get class information and material that you have missed.

### *No-Call, No-Show* Absences

If I (the Professor) were unable to come to class, I would send a message so that students could plan accordingly. I expect the same courtesy from you. Failing to communicate responsibly about your absences — in other words, *ghosting*, or "[No-Call, No-Show](https://myhours.com/articles/no-call-no-show-policy-template-what-is-it-and-how-to-create-one)" events — is not acceptable in this course, and subject to the following policy:

* Your first *No-Call, No-Show* event will reduce your semester grade by one letter (A→B). 
* Your second *No-Call, No-Show* event will cause you to fail the class.

It is expected that there are very few situations in which you would be literally unable to send a brief text message. However, the following incapacitating emergencies are acceptable situations for a *No-Call, No-Show* absence: 

* Death of a family member or loved one
* Serious injuries or accidents that pose a high risk to wellbeing
* Hospitalization
* Physical assault
* Police arrest
* Housefire

Students are responsible for notifying the professor as soon as possible, even in a justified *No-Call, No-Show* situation — i.e. a delayed notice of absence. Depending on the severity of the situation, the notice period should not exceed three days from the day of absence.

### A Word About Absences On Critique Days
Sometimes, students who haven’t completed their projects skip class during critiques, because they are too embarrassed to come to class empty-handed. This type of absence is stupendously self-destructive. Please have courage. Your participation on critique days is essential, even if your own project is incomplete or missing, because these sessions and conversations help you understand our class standards, expectations, and criteria for good work. If you are empty-handed, just say so; it happens. Even if you are without a project, you are still expected to contribute productively to the class discussion. 

### Keeping Mental Presence 
Focus is precious—both yours and others'. Physical presence means nothing if you’re “checked out”; your *mental* presence is extremely important. During the professor’s lectures or guest presentations, distracted participation is prohibited. You are expected to be able to function for a few hours without texting, emailing, chatting, or doing work for other courses. Additionally, your own distraction is demoralizing to those around you. If I observe you doing these things, depending on the circumstance, I may have no choice to correct you publicly.

# COVID-19 in Spring 2024

### Mask-Wearing Expectations
COVID-19 is still with us; the new JN.1 variant is estimated to be highly transmissible, and is circulating widely. You are encouraged to wear a mask if possible, especially as we come back from the holiday travel. A large supply of facial coverings as well as sanitizing wipes can be found near our room's entrance. 

### Health-Related Absences
Please evaluate your own health status regularly and *refrain from attending class and other on-campus events if you feel unwell*. You are emphatically encouraged to seek appropriate medical attention for treatment of illness. In the event of any contagious illness, please do not come to class or to campus to turn in work. Instead, notify me by email about your absence before class, so that accommodations can be made.

### Classroom Streams/Recordings
If you are absent, you are responsible to obtain any information you missed. That said, students who are unable to attend class in person may request that a session be recorded and/or streamed over Zoom. I will make a good-faith effort to accommodate such requests, particularly for *lectures*. However, I can offer no guarantees about the quality of the transmission or recording. For non-lecture events (demonstrations, discussions, critiques, workshops, work days), it may be impossible to document the session satisfactorily.

Recordings of class sessions, if they are made, are covered under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and must not be shared with anyone outside the course. The purpose of these recordings is so students in this course (and only students in this course) can watch or re-watch past class sessions. Feel free to use the recordings if you would like to review something we discussed in class or if you are temporarily unable to attend class.

### Grades in a Time of Stress
The effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic make life extraordinarily stressful for everyone. I’m utterly uninterested in this class being an additional source of stress. We are gathered to make creative work because doing so is a source of meaning, hope, and self-betterment. Do the projects because your heart is in the work, not because you are concerned about grades.

We will have 10 projects this semester. Whether you do them or not, or whether you do them well or not, has no bearing on your grade.

# Rubrics and Grading

### General Expectations
There are a few elementary things you can do to ensure that you receive an excellent grade in this course. These things may seem simple and obvious, but it’s sometimes surprising how few students seem to get this right:

* **Be good**. Have a positive attitude.
* **Be present**. Show up to all of the course sessions, on time.
* **Be responsible**. Communicate with the professor beforehand if you must miss a session.
* **Be helpful**. Help your classmates when they’re stuck.
* **Be generous**. Make helpful contributions to discussions.

Following the recommendations below will not affect your grade, but will bring much greater value to you in our class, at school, and in life: 

* **Be diligent**. Submit all of the Deliverables, on time. And document them clearly and thoroughly. Follow the instructions: do all parts of the Deliverables, paying careful attention to seemingly trivial requirements (such as categorizing your blog posts correctly, formatting your code properly, giving your blog post a title in the requested format etc.).
* **Be fearless**. Work outside your comfort zone. Give yourself permission to weird.
* **Be conscientious**. Pay attention to details of craft and execution.  Put your heart in the work.
* **Be persevering**. Become resourceful about getting the assistance you need.


### Follow Your Passion
*This is art school.* With very rare exceptions (I’ll be clear), I will always prefer that you make the assignment interesting to you — if necessary, by creatively bending the rules or re-interpreting the assignment. Our assignments are starting-points, prompts and propositions. Think beyond them.

Notwithstanding the above, you will always be expected to meet basic expectations in regards to deliverables and documentation. Did you include an image of your project? Did you write the requested narrative?

### Policies for Late Work
Our class is fast-paced. When you submit work late, you lose big-time: not because of some point-deduction scheme, but because you miss the chance to share, show off, discuss and get feedback on your work.

At times this semester, your creative projects may be evaluated by outside experts who review your work in class or online. If your assignment is not visible by the time those persons do their reviews, then your work is officially considered “too late” and may not be able to obtain meaningful feedback.

### Rubrics for Creative Projects 
The purpose of our open-ended Projects is to provide well-circumscribed opportunities for you to make creative work with code. Generally the Project prompts will invite you to explore a specific conceptual theme or set of programming techniques, but, unless stated otherwise, there is no correct solution, and no specific requirement for how to implement your idea. A Project also asks not just for a creative solution, but also for some creativity in defining and approaching the problem. It is expected that your Projects will be documented and published on our WordPress website.

The open-ended Projects will be considered according to the following criteria:

* **Curiosity**: Are you asking questions as you work?
* **Tenacity**: Are you forging through difficult problems without giving up?
* **Execution**: Are you crafting with purpose, precision, and attention?
* **Inventiveness**: Are you discovering/exploring methods outside the obvious and predictable?
* **Fulfillment**: Did you meet all of the requested supporting criteria (such as providing scans of sketches, categorizing your blog post correctly, documenting your process, etc.)?

With Projects, it may not matter how much time a student spent making it. You may sometimes observe a very quickly-executed solution which succeeds because of its strong concept. Usually, however, the quality of a project is rewarded by extra attention to its craft.

Projects always have a list of straightforward *supporting requirements*. If you fail to meet these, you will cause disappointment. Nearly every Project assignment will ask you to:

* Create a unique blog post for your project, on our course website.
* Make sure your blog post is titled and categorized as requested.
* Embed your interactive project into the post, if this is technologically possible.
* Include a static documentation image of your project, such as a screenshot or photograph.
* Include scans or photos of any notebook sketches, if you have them.
In the case of dynamic work, include dynamic documentation too: embed a YouTube, Vimeo demonstrating your project. Often, an animated GIF will be required.
* Write 100-200 words about your project, describing its development process. In your writing, include some critical reflection and analysis of your project: In what ways did you succeed, and in what ways could it be better?
* Embed or link to your code, if appropriate.

**Related to our course policies on Academic Integrity, you must also:**

* *Name any other students* from whom you received advice or help.
If you had collaborators, explain how the work was distributed among the collaborators.
* *Cite and link* to the sources for any code, external libraries, or other media (e.g. photographs, soundtracks, source images) which you used in your Project. Citing your sources is super important, folks. Err on the side of generosity.

In addition to spoken and/or written feedback, the professor may also provide feedback to you on your projects, in the form of letter scores of A,B,C,D, or F, as follows:

* **A** (Excellent): You made something notable
* **B** (Good): You made something that fulfills all requirements
* **C** (Needs Improvement): You tried to make something
* **D** (Unacceptable): You didn’t really try
* **F** (Nothing submitted): You didn’t show up

# Academic Integrity
Your behavior as a responsible member of the new-media arts community is very important — as demonstrated, for example, by properly citing your sources and borrowed code, and crediting those who have helped you. These expectations and obligations are addressed here, in our course Academic Integrity Policy.

### Use of Free and Open-Source Code in Projects
**Credit is perhaps the most important form of currency** in the economies of commons-based peer production and open-source media arts. You are expected to cite the source of any code you use. Please note the following expectations and guidelines:

* **Use Libraries**. In your Projects, the use of general, reusable libraries is strongly encouraged. The people who developed and contributed these components to the community worked hard, often for no pay; acknowledge them by citing their name and linking to their repository.
* **Be Careful**. It sometimes happens that an artist places the entire source code for their artwork online. You should probably avoid this code. But at the very least, you should be very, very careful about approaching such code for possible re-use. If it is necessary to do so, it is best to extract components that solve a specific technical problem, rather than those parts which operate to create a unique experience. Your challenge, if and/or when you work with others’ code, is to *make it your own*. Doing so without proper citation would be actionable plagiarism.

### Policies Regarding Informal Collaboration
Our course places a very high value on civic responsibility that includes, but is not limited to, helping others learn. In this course, I strongly encourage you to give help (or ask others for help) in using various toolkits, algorithms, libraries, or other facilities. Please note the following expectations:

* In this class, *it’s OK to give and receive help*. In fact, it’s better than OK! But students who receive help from someone else are obliged to acknowledge that person in their project report, clarifying the nature of the help that was received.
* *We are all teachers*. Students with advanced skills are expected to help others, yet refrain from doing another’s work for them. You can usually tell when you’re about to cross the line: Ask yourself whether you are teaching someone to fish, or merely giving them the fish.
* When in doubt: *give credit* to the people who have helped you.

### Policies Regarding Formal Collaboration
The assignments in this course are primarily intended to be executed by individuals. That said, I am in favor of students collaborating if such collaborations arise organically and can be conducted safely. Please note the following expectations:

* *Notify the Professor*. It’s helpful for me to know who is working with whom. Students who wish to collaborate should jointly inform the professor as early as possible.
* *Describe who did what*. Written reports for collaborative projects should describe how your effort was distributed.
* *Only collaborators from this class*. Your project collaborator, if you have one, must be in this class. You may not collaborate with people from outside the course (e.g. your housemate).
* *Avoid co-dependency*. You may not collaborate with the same person (i.e. submit assignments jointly) for more than two projects.


---
# Code of Conduct

### Code of Conduct
I am committed to providing an educational experience that is free of harassment and intimidation for everyone in this course—regardless of aspects like gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, handicap or disability, physical appearance, body size, race, color, ethnicity, nationality, ancestry, religion, creed, or technology choices. I will not tolerate any form of harassment and/or discriminatory, oppressive, suppressive, or violent behavior. I expect all of the participants in our course community to adhere to this code of conduct—including me, the Professor.

If someone engages in harassing behavior, I may take any action deemed appropriate in the Carnegie Mellon University Policy against [Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault](https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and-governance/sexual-harassment-and-sexual-assault.html), [Discriminatory Harassment](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/community-policies/discriminatory-harassment.html), or other [community policies](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/community-policies/index.html). If you experience or witness harassment, threatening behavior, suppressive behavior, or have any other concerns, I encourage you to speak up, say something, and/or let us know immediately.

### Inclusivity Statement
It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. I will gladly honor your request to address you by the pronouns and name you specify.

I commit to make individual arrangements to address disabilities or religious needs (e.g. religious events in conflict with class meetings). Please advise me of these requirements early in the semester so that I may make appropriate accommodations.

---
# Freedom of Speech Commitment

This course may present content that includes nudity and imagery, language, or dialogue that may offend some students. In viewing and discussing works of art, we encourage the broadest possible tolerance consistent with United States law.

Being in an art school, you should expect to be exposed to content that challenges your moral, ethical, and aesthetic values. In the unlikely case of extremely graphic content, I will warn the class in advance, but please let me know privately if there are types of content that you find upsetting.

---
# Taking Care of Yourself

**Take care of yourself**. Your well-being is more important than your performance in this course. Please do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.

An important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. The following resources are available:

* **[Counseling and Psychological Services](http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/) (CaPS) Counseling: +1-412-268-2922**

# Land Notice
Carnegie Mellon University is situated on land that has been continuously inhabited for over 16,000 years, serving as a home to members of the Adena, Hopewell, Monongahela, Lenape, Shawnee, Wyandot, Tisagechroami, Delaware, and Mohican communities before becoming a territory of the Iroquois Confederacy. The Iroquois Confederacy included the Mohawk, Onondaga, Oneida, Cayuga, Seneca, and Tuscarora people, whose relationships with the land continue to this day. The Seneca name for Pittsburgh is [Dionde:gâ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Pittsburgh).
