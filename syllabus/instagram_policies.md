Drawing with Machines • Fall 2025 • Prof. Golan Levin, CMU

---

This semester we will share an Instagram channel, @[**DrawingWithMachines**](https://www.instagram.com/drawingwithmachines/). This account is a collective space for our class community to document and share our work, process, and experiments in code-based drawing. Think of this as a gift to your future self! Here are some guidelines to help us use it responsibly and respectfully:

### 🔒 Respect and Privacy

* Only post your own work (finished or in progress), or the work of others with their explicit permission. Feel free to sign your posts with your first name or initials if you want.
* Don’t post photos or videos of classmates unless they’ve agreed to be shown.
* Even with permission, please avoid tagging individuals in photos. Let’s protect each other’s privacy.

### ✍️ Purpose and Content

* This account is for sharing our process: sketches, code, plotter failures, final drawings, experiments. Think of it as a studio logbook — not a portfolio.
* Feel free to include short captions or reflections — what you were trying, what worked, what surprised you.
* Do not post off-topic content (memes, unrelated selfies, promotions, etc.).
* When relevant, feel free to tag tools or platforms we’re using (e.g. @axidraw, @p5xjs) or use hashtags like `#plotterart`, `#generativeart`, or `#creativecoding`. 

### 🔐 Account Security

* Login details for our account are in our `#key-information` Discord channel.
* Do not share the login info outside of our class.
* Do not change the password, linked email, or any account settings.
* If you notice suspicious behavior or login issues, report it to Golan immediately.

### 🤝 Follows, Likes, and Comments

* Please don’t use the class account to follow friends, influencers, or unrelated accounts.
* It’s okay to follow artists, labs, or projects relevant to generative art, drawing machines, or creative code.
* Be thoughtful with likes and comments — remember that you’re speaking on behalf of our entire group.
* Do not use the account to send or reply to direct messages (DMs). If someone messages us, let Golan know.

### 🚫 Community Standards

* Obviously: no hate speech, harassment, NSFW content, or private messaging through the account.
* Follow Instagram’s [Terms of Service](https://help.instagram.com/581066165581870) and [Community Guidelines](https://transparency.meta.com/policies/community-standards/).
* Misuse of the account could result in disciplinary action and/or the removal of access for the entire group.

*Thanks for helping make this a welcoming, thoughtful, and inspiring archive of our collective work!*
