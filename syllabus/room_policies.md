This semester, Room CFA-303 is shared by two courses:

* **Stop Frame Animation** (T/Th 8:00–11:00am)
* **Drawing with Machines** (M/W 7:00–10:00pm)

Outside of these scheduled sessions — and unless otherwise notified — the room is available for students enrolled in either class to work on their projects. Please help keep our lab functional, welcoming, and safe by following the guidelines below.

### 🤫 Noise and Focus

Creating a place for our classroom community to be creative together is one of my top priorities. But our lab is a **shared studio and workspace**, not just a hangout. It should support concentration, exploration, and deep focus.

* Mental focus is precious. Some folks are trying to think, write code, or troubleshoot — they may need quiet.
* **Keep conversations low-key**, and **avoid boisterous behavior** or playing distracting media. Laughter is great, group chat is great — but if the room feels like a party, it’s probably too loud.
* If someone looks locked in, let them stay that way. We all want to feel comfortable here; please don’t make it harder for someone else to focus.
* Don’t make me tap the sign. 🙃


### 🔧 Equipment Use

* Treat our equipment with care and respect. If something breaks, report it immediately — accidents happen, but silence causes problems.
* Always return tools and materials to their designated places.
* There are some library books I have borrowed for us to browse for inspiration. These should not be removed from the room. 
* Some plots can take a lot of time. Please try to share access equitably: in particular, don’t monopolize specialized machines. Time limits may be enforced if demand is high.


### 🤝 Sharing Space with the Other Class

* **Do not move, borrow, or touch setups, materials, or artwork belonging to the Stop Frame Animation course.**
* If their materials are accidentally in your way, ask a faculty member before moving them.
* Leave the room clean and ready for the next class: wipe surfaces, throw away trash, and don’t leave half-finished projects out unless they’re clearly labeled.


### 👥 Guests and Room Security

* You may bring a friend to visit or observe while you work, **but please do not invite people to hang out or use the space casually.**
* Guests may not use our lab’s equipment, computers, or supplies.
* Guests should not be left unattended. You are responsible for your guests’ behavior in our space.
* Random people sometimes wander CFA, and thefts have occurred. **The last person to leave must ensure the door is locked.**
* Always take your CMU ID badge with you if you step out. **Do not prop the door open and walk away — ever.** 


### 🧃 Food and Drinks

* You may eat dry, clean snacks, but please **keep food and open drinks away from laptops, artwork, and machines.**
* **No messy or greasy meals** (e.g. sauce-heavy food) in the lab.
* Dispose of trash immediately — don’t leave wrappers, cans, or compostables behind.


*Thanks for helping make our room a generous, focused, and genuinely collaborative space.*
